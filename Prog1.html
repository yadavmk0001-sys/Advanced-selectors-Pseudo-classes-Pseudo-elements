    <p>Space is a vast and mysterious expanse filled with wonders, from celestial bodies to cosmic phenomena, and here
        are some
        intriguing facts to explore.</p>
    <p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical
        space is
        often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a
        boundless
        four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental
        importance to
        an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it
        is
        itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>
